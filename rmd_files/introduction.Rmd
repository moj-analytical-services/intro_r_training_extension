# Introduction

This course builds on the original Introduction to R training course, and covers additional programming concepts. It provides examples that demonstrate how the Tidyverse packages can assist with tasks typically encountered in DASD.

## Learning outcomes

### By the end of this session you should know how to:

 - Classify a variable in a dataframe, based on a set of conditions
 - Apply a function to multiple columns in a dataframe
 - Search for a string pattern in a dataframe
 - Reshape dataframes
 - Deal with missing values in a dataframe


## Before we start
To follow along with the code run during this session and participate in the exercises, open the script "example_code.R" in RStudio. All the code that we'll show in this session is stored in "example_code.R", and you can edit this script to write solutions to the exercises. You may also want to have the course [read me](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/intro_r_training_extension) open as a reference.
