# Introduction

This course builds on the original Introduction to R training course, and covers additional programming concepts. It provides examples that demonstrate how the Tidyverse packages can assist with tasks typically encountered in DASD.

Development of the Tidyverse suite of packages was led by Hadley Wickham, and more information about these packages can be found on the [Tidyverse website](https://www.tidyverse.org/) as well as in the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

## Learning outcomes

### By the end of this session you should know how to:

 - Classify a variable in a dataframe, based on a set of conditions
 - Deal with missing values in a dataframe
 - Easily apply a function to any number of columns in a dataframe
 - Search for a string pattern in a dataframe
 - Reshape dataframes


## Before we start

To follow along with the code run during this session and participate in the exercises, open the script "example_code.R" in RStudio. All the code that we'll show in this session is stored in "example_code.R", and you can edit this script to write solutions to the exercises. You may also want to have the course [read me](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/intro_r_training_extension) open as a reference.

First, we need to load a few packages and an example dataset.

```{r message=F, warning=F, purl=purl_example_code}
# Load packages
library(s3tools)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
```
